## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Momentum Strategies

Momentum strategies are based on the observation that assets that have performed well in the recent past tend to continue performing well in the near future. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) first documented the momentum effect in equity markets, showing that stocks with high returns over the past 3-12 months tend to outperform stocks with low returns.

**Key Findings:**
- Momentum effect persists across different markets and time periods
- Returns are higher for small-cap stocks and during high volatility periods
- Momentum strategies can generate significant alpha but are prone to crashes

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Finance

Machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to financial markets for prediction and strategy development. Gu et al. (2020) provide a comprehensive survey of ML applications in finance, highlighting the potential of deep learning models for capturing complex market dynamics.

**Key Applications:**
- **Time Series Prediction**: LSTM and CNN models for price prediction

- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for improved performance
- **Risk Management**: ML-based position sizing and risk assessment

### 2.3 Multi-Factor Models

Multi-factor models combine multiple sources of return and risk to create more robust strategies. Fama and French (1993) introduced the three-factor model, which has been extended to include momentum and other factors.

**Factor Categories:**
